Live visualization of all the Pokémon (with option to show gyms, raids and PokéStops) in your area. This is a proof of concept that we can load all the Pokémon visible nearby given a location. Currently runs on a Flask server displaying Google Maps with markers on it.

## What does DarkFork have that other RM forks don't:

1. Cool navigation-bar filters like filtering/including/excluding per Pokémon type, generation and special tiers.
2. Gen nr. in your Pokémon labels
3. Get notified for Tiny Rats & Big Karps + the option to prio-notify Pokémon (Pokémon in notify filters will ALWAYS be visible)
4. Depending on your -rh (rarity-hours) setting, Pokémon  will get assigned 'New Spawn' when your map hasn't seen this pokemon for `<rh-setting>` hours
5. The option to import/export your customized map settings
6. Keep a list of your favorite locations!

And more to be added!
